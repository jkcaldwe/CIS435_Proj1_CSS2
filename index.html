        <h1><strong>W</strong>elcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
	        <p>
	        	I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.  But during the last year, I started
	        	selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join
	        	my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
